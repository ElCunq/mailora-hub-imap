# Agent Instructions

This repository is maintained by an AI agent (Cline). The `memory_bank/` directory serves as its persistent brain.

**Rules for Humans:**
- Read `memory_bank/activeContext.md` to see what's being worked on.
- Check `memory_bank/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` before reporting bugs.
- If you make manual changes, please update `memory_bank/progress.md` or ask the agent to "update the memory bank".

**Rules for Agents:**
- Read `memory_bank/*` at the start of every session.
- Update `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` after every significant task.
- Follow patterns defined in `systemPatterns.md`.
